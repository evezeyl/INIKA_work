# Laboratory course 

We selected 20 isolates :

-   6 isolates are ***Klebsiella spp.*** isolates
-   6 isolates are *Escherichia coli* isolates
-   8 isolates are *Salmonella spp.* isolates


## Results of isolates species  identification

- some isolates could not be identified 
- the reasons would be
    - no colony
    - it could be several strains (>2) 
         - not being to be able to distinguish between species OR 
         - it can be an admixture of species  
- some of the strains have something else 
  - Enterobacter (not interested in)

  
Emmanuel : A2 and C1

Maulid : A4 and C4

Anna : B3 and D4

Janicke and Camilla : take the 3 others - they demonstrate and the students do the same. 
C&J D1, D2, C2

- DNA extraction maybe later today.
